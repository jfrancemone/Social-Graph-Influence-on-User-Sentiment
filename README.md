### **Project Overview**

This project simulates the dynamics of **Social Balance Theory** to predict how users form affinity for new nodes (people/content) in a network. Across three experimental studies, I modeled triadic closure, which is the principle that drives social recommendation engines (e.g., friend of a friend).

By manipulating the valence of network connections (Positive vs. Negative edges), I identified the conditions under which **Algorithmic Suggestions** succeed (Assimilation) or backfire (Contrast), validating the predictive framework used in optimizing social graphs.

### **Key Findings & Strategic Insights**

#### **1. Network Context Predicts Sentiment**
Content is not judged in a vacuum.
* **The Finding:** A user's evaluation of a target is significantly biased by their relationship with the *introducer* (the intermediary node).
* **The Mechanism:** **Assimilation** (liking what your friends like) and **Contrast** (disliking what your enemies like) accounted for variance in sentiment even when the target's actual behavior was ambiguous.
* **Application:** In recommendation systems, the "Source" of the recommendation (e.g., "Liked by [Friend]") is as predictive of engagement as the content itself.

#### **2. The "Enemy of My Enemy" Effect**
* **The Finding:** Negative relationships in a social graph are highly predictive. Users consistently formed positive alliances with targets who were antagonistic toward a shared "enemy."
* **Strategic Insight:** Algorithms that only optimize for positive engagement miss valid connection opportunities driven by shared out-groups or competitive dynamics.

#### **3. Predicting Algorithmic Backfire**
* **The Risk:** Connecting a user to a target via a "negative node" (a disliked intermediary) consistently resulted in lower affinity than a cold start (no connection).
* **Trust & Safety:** Algorithms must account for "Negative Graph Latency"—avoiding recommendations that traverse through blocked or muted user nodes to prevent "Contrast Effects."

### **Methodology**

* **Design:** Multi-Study Experimental Series (Simulated Social Triads).
* **Participants:** N ≈ 1,500 across 3 studies.
* **Framework:** **Heider’s Balance Theory** (P-O-X Triads) applied to network structures.
* **Analysis:**
    * **Factorial ANOVA:** To test main effects of network valence on sentiment.
    * **Contrast Analysis:** To measure the magnitude of Assimilation vs. Contrast effects.
* **Tools:**
    * **SPSS:** Primary statistical modeling.
    * **Process Macro:** Mediation and moderation analysis.
